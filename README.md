# LinkedList
Linked Lists are used when the number of elements is not known in advance i.e. size is not known as linked lists support dynamic memory allocation. Linked lists are simple and can be used to implement other data structures like stack, queue, and tree. Linked Lists can be used for the manipulation of polynomials.
